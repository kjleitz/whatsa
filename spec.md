# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application (You can access Whatsa by running the command `whatsa` after installing it, then follow the on-screen instructions in your terminal to interact. The rest is explained in the README.)
- [x] Pull data from an external source (This application pulls data from articles, disambiguation pages, and search results pages on Wikipedia.org)
- [x] Implement both list and detail views (If you make a query that is ambiguous, the app will present a list to you, from which you can select a choice by number or name. If you wish to read from a specific category/section of an article, you can type `other` and it will present a similarly-selectable list of sections. Once you get to an article or a section, it will display its summary, and if you'd like more, you can ask for that too.)
